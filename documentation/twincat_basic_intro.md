TwinCAT is developed by Beckhoff and integrates the EtherCAT driver. It utilizes the **Structured Text (IEC 61131)** as programming language, designed for programmable logical controllers (PLCs). This section will introduce the basic syntax, data types and structures we are going to use in TwinCAT.

TwinCAT is an IDE that specializes in PLC programming, based on Visual Studio 2017. When we test code locally, it will create a virtual machine and upload the compiled code to the virtual machine. After we logged in the virtual machine in TwinCAT, we are able to start the program we wrote, observe or change the variables values in real time.

This Youtube playlist [PLC programming using TwinCAT 3](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLimaF0nZKYHz3I3kFP4myaAYjmYk1SowO&si=meIGl07Yj3mRG5ff) clearly demonstrates how to use TwinCAT to program PLC with **Structured Text**. If you can spend hours to watch all the videos, then you will be a master in PLC programming.

In the meantime, this wiki aimed at creating a handbook that project members can make it as a swift reference for debugging or programming purpose.
