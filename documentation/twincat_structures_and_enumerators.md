Structures and numerators are essential for making the code easy to read and clean. 

## Structures
Structures are self defined data types with whatever data you want to wrap up. For functions and methods, this means instead of returning multiple values, you can just return less data structures with well organized data. This would make the code easier to read and clean.

To declare structures, you need to first create the structure file. Right click on solution explorer, `Add...` -> `DUT...` will allows you to create a structure file. Then you can revise the name of structure and select what type of structure you are creating. For instance you can choose structure.
